## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Taking up this challenge helped me review my fundamentals on HTML and CSS. I found using flexbox effective enough to achieve the desired result.

### Continued development

My usual things to improve I forget some basic stuff such as how to import stuff (fonts via urls) every now and then, that I have to consult documentations.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started) - This gave me an example on using Google Fonts API
